# Schematic Maps

## Illustrating IV Corps Operations in the PO Valley

The collection features numerous schematic maps that **prioritize illustrating connections over geographic
accuracy**. These maps depict key relationships between operations, such as American forces' movements in the North
Apennines and Po Valley near the end of World War II. We can create guided tours around annotations that present users
with additional context about the various regions of the map images.

## Using Geospatial Annotations to Illustrate Schematic Maps

Furthermore, by incorporating georeferencing annotations and a georeferencing viewer, we can add geospatial context to
these schematic maps, helping users gain a clearer understanding of the locations associated with each event node.
