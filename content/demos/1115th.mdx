# 1115th Engineer Combat Group

The 1115th Engineer Combat Group played a vital role in the European Theater during World War II, supporting the XIX
Corps from the D-Day landings on Omaha Beach through operations in France, Belgium, and into Germany. Initially formed
in 1942, this group included multiple engineering units like the 82nd Engineer Combat Battalion and others, primarily
tasked with constructing and maintaining bridges, clearing obstacles, and ensuring troop mobility across the challenging
European landscape.

Notably, the 1115th constructed almost two miles of bridges, including large floating pontoon bridges to support the
crossing of major rivers like the Seine and Elbe. Their expertise allowed American forces to advance rapidly, with the
group adapting to dynamic wartime needs such as building both temporary and semi-permanent structures under combat
conditions. This support contributed significantly to the Allied push across Europe, linking up with other units and
overcoming logistical challenges across various terrains.
