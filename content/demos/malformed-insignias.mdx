# Symbolic Alterations: Reimagined Insignias of Axis Divisions

Insignias appear frequently on maps throughout the collection. While most insignias are historically accurate, some maps
feature altered insignias, especially those representing Axis forces, modified to signify the defeat or destruction of
these units. One example is found in *With the IV Corps in the Italian Campaign, June 1944 - May 1945: 325 Days of Continuous Fighting*.

## Example: 26th Panzer Division

The original insignia of the 26th Panzer Division (Germany) typically looks like this:

/>

However, on this particular map, the insignia has been modified—displaying a sword driven into the head on the insignia,
with the face also missing. This alteration appears intentional, symbolizing the division’s destruction.

/>

## Example: 90th Panzergrenadier Division

The insignia of the 90th Panzergrenadier Division typically includes a sword over the island of Sardinia, referencing
the division’s formation there in 1943:

/>

In this map, however, the sword in the insignia is depicted as impaling the island of Sardinia, signifying the
division’s origins and its eventual fate.
