Harbor, enroute to foreign shores, on Oct.22. Arrival at Southampton, England, was made Nov.2 after an uneventful, eleven-day crossing. The following 5 weeks at Oulton Park Camp near Chester, Englad, were spent readying our equipment for the Channel Crossing. Early in Dec. we moved across the Channel in 5 separate ships... a portion of the battalion docking at Le Havre, the remainder at Rouen, France. Assembling in the\u0026nbsp; Vicinity of the Chateau de Merval....near Fry, France, we awaited further orders. On Dec. 22 and 23 a 30-hour convoy took us to Merkstein, Germany.

It meant building numerous bridges and maintaining suply routes under constant strafing and shell-fire..... in order that the 84th and 102nd Infantry and the 5th Armored Divisions could smash Hitler's fast-fading \"Super-men\". On Mar. 31.... after 5 weeks spent near Krefeld.... we crossed the Rhine at Wesel in direct support of the 5th Armored. Our lightning-like advances were long and frequent-- always with missions to accomplish.... mines to be cleared, bridges to be built, roads to be repaired. We bridged the Weser River.... billetted temporarily in the vicinities of Munster, Hanover and Brunswick...... finally halting on the banks of the Elbe River in April of '45. Casualties numbering 13 were inflicted on our battalion when Jerry unleashed 200 anti-personnel bombs at Stapel. When the enemy frantically swarmed the West bank of the Elbe in face of the Russian onslaught we were assigned to engin- eer a PW enclosure at Calbe. South of Magdeburg, at Barby, elements of the 292ND were among the first engineer troops to reach the opposite bank of the Elbe. It was there that we officially greeted some of the first Red units to complete the Allied junction at the River. A 3-day convoy down through the Harz Mts., and along the Autobahn Highway past Frankfurt, brought us further, post-war details in Mainz. July we spent in Liege, Bel-gium. At Antwerp, under Lt. Col.
